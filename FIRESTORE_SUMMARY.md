## 🗄️ Firestore Data Structure

```
users/
  {userId}/
    notes/              (existing)
      {noteId}
    
    workoutLogs/        (NEW)
      {logId}
        - userId
        - programId
        - weekNumber
        - dayNumber
        - date
        - startTime
        - endTime
        - rating (1-5 stars)
        - notes
        - sections[]
          - type (warmup/main/cooldown)
          - exercises[]
            - exerciseId
            - sets[]
              - reps / duration
              - completed
    
    progress/           (NEW)
      current
        - currentWeek
        - currentDay
        - startDate
        - completedWorkouts[]
        - streak
        - longestStreak
        - lastWorkoutDate
```

## 🔄 Workflow

### 1. User Completes Workout
```typescript
// User finishes all exercises and clicks "Complete & Save"
await completeWorkout(notes, rating)
```

### 2. Data Saved to Firestore
```typescript
// Creates workout log document
const logId = await saveWorkoutLog(userId, {
  programId: "12-week-fitness-program",
  weekNumber: 1,
  dayNumber: 1,
  startTime: Date,
  endTime: Date,
  sections: [...],
  notes: "Great workout!",
  rating: 5
})
```

### 3. Progress Updated
```typescript
// Updates user progress
await updateUserProgress(userId, logId, weekNumber, dayNumber)
// - Adds log to completedWorkouts[]
// - Calculates streak
// - Updates currentWeek/currentDay
```

### 4. User Navigated to Dashboard
```typescript
// Context resets workout state
// Dashboard shows updated progress
```

## 🔒 Security

All data is protected by Firestore security rules:
- Users can only read/write their own data
- `userId` field is validated on creation
- Authentication required for all operations

## 📊 Features Enabled

✅ **Workout History** - All completed workouts saved with full details
✅ **Progress Tracking** - Current week/day automatically tracked
✅ **Streak Calculation** - Daily workout streaks computed
✅ **Performance Ratings** - 1-5 star ratings for each workout
✅ **Workout Notes** - Personal notes for each session
✅ **Exercise Details** - Reps, duration, sets all recorded
✅ **Auto-Initialization** - New users automatically set up

## 🎯 Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

- [ ] Create workout history page to view past workouts
- [ ] Add progress dashboard with charts and statistics
- [ ] Display workout calendar with completion markers
- [ ] Show weekly/monthly progress trends
- [ ] Add goal setting and achievement tracking
- [ ] Implement workout reminders
- [ ] Add exercise PR (Personal Record) tracking
- [ ] Create leaderboards for competitive motivation

## 🧪 Testing

To test the integration:

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Sign in with Google
3. Complete a workout with rating and notes
4. Check Firebase Console → Firestore Database
5. Verify documents created in:
   - `users/{uid}/workoutLogs/{logId}`
   - `users/{uid}/progress/current`

## 📝 Deployment Notes

**Before deploying to production:**

1. Deploy Firestore security rules:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

2. Verify rules in Firebase Console:
   - Firestore Database → Rules tab
   - Test with different user scenarios

3. Monitor Firestore usage:
   - Check Firebase Console → Usage tab
   - Watch for read/write patterns
   - Optimize queries if needed

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- Workout logs use automatic timestamps (server-side)
- Queries are ordered by date for efficient retrieval
- Progress document uses single doc per user (efficient reads)
- Indexes may be needed for complex queries (Firebase will prompt)
