# Progressive 12-Week Workout System - Implementation Summary

## Date: October 21, 2025

## Overview
Successfully implemented a **progressive 12-week workout program** with week-specific exercise variations, progressive overload, and intensity increases.

---

## What Was Added

### 1. **New Exercises** (10 additional exercises)
Added to `src/data/mainExercises.ts`:

- **Standing Calf Raise** (both legs) - Week 3+
- **Back / Goblet Squats with Weight** - Week 4+ (5kg â†’ 20kg progression)
- **Inverted Rows with Weight** - Week 4+ (weighted version)
- **Push Ups with Weight** - Week 4+ (weighted version)
- **Full Crunches** - Week 4+ (progression from partial crunches)
- **Grip and Hang with Weight** - Week 4+ (weighted version)
- **Pinch Holds** - Week 4+ (grip strength)
- **Superman Hold** - Week 5+ (isometric back extension)
- **Wide Grip Chin Up** - Week 7+ (pull-up progression)
- **Parallel Bar Dip** - Week 7+ (advanced pushing exercise)

### 2. **Weekly Workout Configurations**
Created `src/data/weeklyWorkoutConfigs.ts`:

Each week (1-12) has specific:
- **Reps** (varying from 8-15 based on week)
- **Sets** (1-3 based on progression)
- **Weight recommendations** (5kg â†’ 20kg over 12 weeks)
- **Cardio duration** (12min â†’ 30min)

### 3. **Updated Workout Program Logic**
Modified `src/data/workoutProgram.ts`:

- Now dynamically pulls week-specific exercises
- Creates appropriate strength/cardio days per week
- Maintains 6-day training schedule (Mon/Wed/Fri strength, Tue/Thu/Sat cardio, Sun rest)

## Progressive Overload Schedule

- **Week 2**: Increased sets to 3, increased reps to 10-15
- **Week 3**: Both legs calf raise, 3 sets on most exercises, 15min cardio

### **Weeks 4-6: Adding Weight** (5kg â†’ 7.5kg)
- **Week 4**: Introduce weighted exercises (5kg), add pinch holds
- **Week 5**: Increase weight to 7.5kg, add Superman hold, 17min cardio
- **Week 6**: Increase sets to 3, continue 7.5kg

### **Weeks 7-8: Advanced Movements** (10kg)
- **Week 7**: Introduce chin-ups and dips, 10kg weight, 20min cardio
- **Week 8**: Increase sets and pinch hold sets

### **Weeks 9-10: Heavy Load** (12.5kg-15kg)
- **Week 9**: 12.5kg or 15kg, 7 rep chin-ups/dips, 25min cardio

## Key Features

- Sets increase: 1-2 â†’ 3 across weeks
- Weight increases: 0kg â†’ 20kg over 12 weeks
- Cardio duration: 12min â†’ 30min

### âœ… **Exercise Progression**
- Week 1-3: Bodyweight basics
- Week 4-6: Weighted versions introduced
- Week 7+: Advanced movements (chin-ups, dips)

### âœ… **Recovery**
- Sunday always REST day
- Rest between sets: 60 seconds
- Failure-based exercises (grip/hang, pinch holds)

### âœ… **Cardio Progression**
| Week | Duration |
|------|----------|
| 1-2  | 12 min   |
| 3-4  | 15 min   |

## How It Works

### **Data Structure**
```typescript
weeklyWorkoutConfigs.get(weekNumber) â†’ {
  strength: Exercise[], // Mon/Wed/Fri workouts
  cardio: Exercise[]    // Tue/Thu/Sat workouts
}
```

### **Dynamic Exercise Loading**
The app now:
1. Checks user's current week (from `UserProgress.currentWeek`)
2. Loads appropriate week config from `weeklyWorkoutConfigs`
3. Displays week-specific exercises with correct reps/sets
4. Shows weight recommendations in exercise descriptions

### **User Experience**
- **Dashboard**: Shows current week number
- **Active Workout**: Displays week-specific exercises
- **Progress Page**: Tracks completion across all 12 weeks
- **Automatic Progression**: App tracks which week user is on

## Files Modified

1. âœ… **src/data/mainExercises.ts** - Added 10 new exercises
2. âœ… **src/data/weeklyWorkoutConfigs.ts** - NEW FILE - Week-specific configs
3. âœ… **src/data/workoutProgram.ts** - Updated to use dynamic week configs

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Build succeeds âœ… (DONE - build successful)
- [ ] Week 1 shows correct exercises (bodyweight only)
- [ ] Week 4 shows weighted exercises with 5kg note
- [ ] Week 7 shows chin-ups and dips
- [ ] Week 12 shows peak performance config
- [ ] Cardio duration increases properly across weeks
- [ ] UI displays week number clearly
- [ ] Progress tracking works across all 12 weeks

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test in browser** - Start workout and verify week-specific exercises appear
2. **Test progression** - Manually change week number and verify exercises change
3. **Update UI** - Consider adding week indicator badge on exercise cards
4. **Add weight tracker** - Optional: Let users log actual weight used
5. **Commit changes** - Push to GitHub once tested

---

## Technical Notes

### **Exercise ID Convention**
- Base exercises: `exercise-name`
- Weighted variations: `exercise-name-weighted`
- New exercises: `exercise-name` (unique)

### **Override Pattern**
```typescript
getExercise('exercise-id', { 
  defaultReps: X, 
  defaultSets: Y,
  description: 'Weight note'
})
```

### **Fallback**
If week config not found, throws error (prevents silent failures)

## Weight Progression Table

| Week | Weight    | New Exercises Added             |
|------|-----------|----------------------------------|

| 4    | 5kg       | Weighted squats, rows, push-ups |
