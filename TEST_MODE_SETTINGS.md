# Test Mode & Settings Implementation

## Date: October 22, 2025

## Overview
Enhanced the Test Mode to save workouts to the database (mimicking actual workout sessions) and added a Settings page with the ability to delete all workout data and reset progress.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Test Mode Now Saves Workouts ‚úÖ

**File:** `src/pages/TestWorkout.tsx`

**Key Changes:**
- Added workout tracking with `exerciseData` state
- Added `completedExercises` Set to track finished exercises
- Records `workoutStartTime` when test begins
- Saves complete workout log to Firestore on completion

**Data Tracking:**
```typescript
const [workoutStartTime] = useState<Date>(new Date());
const [exerciseData, setExerciseData] = useState<Map<string, ExerciseCompletion>>(new Map());
const [completedExercises, setCompletedExercises] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
```

**Exercise Completion:**
```typescript
const handleCompleteSet = () => {
  if (currentSet === totalSets) {
    // Save exercise data with mechanic
    const exerciseCompletion: ExerciseCompletion = {
      exerciseId: currentExercise.id,
      mechanic: currentExercise.mechanic,
      sets: Array.from({ length: totalSets }, () => ({
        completed: true,
        reps: (mechanic === 'reps') ? reps : undefined,
        duration: (mechanic === 'timed/hold/failure') ? timer : undefined
      }))
    };
    setExerciseData(prev => new Map(prev).set(currentExercise.id, exerciseCompletion));
  }
};
```

**Workout Save on Completion:**
```typescript
await saveWorkoutLog(user.uid, {
  programId: 'test-12-week-beginner',
  weekNumber,
  dayNumber,
  startTime: workoutStartTime,
  endTime: new Date(),
  sections: completedSections,
  notes: 'Test Mode Workout',
  rating: 0
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Test Mode workouts now count toward your progress
- Shows up in Progress page history
- Contributes to workout streaks
- Same data structure as regular workouts
- Useful for testing new weeks or previewing exercises

### 2. Delete All Workout Data Function ‚úÖ

**File:** `src/utils/firestore.ts`

Added three new functions:

**a) Delete All Workout Logs:**
```typescript
export const deleteAllWorkoutLogs = async (uid: string): Promise<void> => {
  const logsRef = getWorkoutLogsCollection(uid);
  const querySnapshot = await getDocs(logsRef);
  const deletePromises = querySnapshot.docs.map(doc => deleteDoc(doc.ref));
  await Promise.all(deletePromises);
};
```

**b) Reset User Progress:**
```typescript
export const resetUserProgress = async (uid: string): Promise<void> => {
  const progressRef = getUserProgressDoc(uid);
  await setDoc(progressRef, {
    currentWeek: 1,
    currentDay: 1,
    startDate: Timestamp.now(),
    completedWorkouts: [],
    streak: 0,
    longestStreak: 0,
  });
};
```

**c) Delete All Workout Data (Combined):**
```typescript
export const deleteAllWorkoutData = async (uid: string): Promise<void> => {
  await deleteAllWorkoutLogs(uid);
  await resetUserProgress(uid);
};
```

          "mechanic": "reps",
          "sets": [
            { "reps": 12, "completed": true },
            { "reps": 10, "completed": true },
            { "reps": 8, "completed": true }
